# Summary
This project uses Spotify playlist data to track the genres, names and other 
qualities of the most popular songs of the last 60 years. Using this data, out application will visualize the changes in popular music over the last half century, showing the rise of new genres, and also how the quality of popular music has changed (tempo, wordiness, etc.) 

## API

# Endpoint /all-songs/year?genre

The first endpoint we will define will fetch all the songs in our data from a specific year. If the client does not request a specific genre to be given, all songs from that year will be in the response. If a specific genre query is passed, say Rock, all Rock songs for that year will be the response.

# Endpoint /most-popular/year

This endpoint will return the 10 most popular songs of a given year defined by the Data's "Popularity" value. Optionally, allow query parameter to return different amounts of songs

# Endpoint /all-songs

Simply returns all-songs in the dataset

# Endpoint /highest-tempo/number

This endpoint is more of a stretch goal, can return the highest tempo songs of a given genre or maybe year. Could be interesting for a recap of a year type page on our application.
